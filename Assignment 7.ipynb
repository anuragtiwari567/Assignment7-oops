It involves defining classes in such a way that users of those classes don't need to be aware of the internal structure and implementation of the data. This can be achieved through a combination of encapsulation and providing well-defined methods for data access and manipulation.\n",

    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation involves bundling the data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data within a single class. By setting access modifiers (such as public, protected, and private), you control how the attributes can be accessed from outside the class. This helps in hiding the implementation details of the data.\n",

    "Getter and Setter Methods: Instead of allowing direct access to attributes, you can provide getter methods to retrieve attribute values and setter methods to modify attribute values. This allows you to control how data is accessed and modified, enabling you to implement additional logic or validation.\n",

    "Private Attributes: While Python doesn't enforce strict access control like some other languages, you can use naming conventions to indicate that certain attributes are meant to be treated as private. By convention, attributes starting with an underscore (e.g., _private_attribute) are considered private, and users are encouraged not to access them directly."
